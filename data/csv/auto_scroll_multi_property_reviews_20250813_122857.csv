Was always throughly pleased and impressed with The Waters when I visited some friends who lived here last year. Rebecca Elliot was extremely kind and very knowledgeable when welcoming us in, presenting leasing options, and giving us a tour of the place. Very excited to be moving in here 2 months from now. Very clean, still has that brand new feel, and a very fresh and welcoming community space. This definitely will be the nicest rental property I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Without a doubt the best apartment space to rent in Hammond, LA.",2025,Ross Chauvin,2025-08-13T12:26:43.822383

I had a wonderful experience on my tour and Ms. Kamryn was very helpful in answering all of my questions.

My friend and I were in the search of apartments in the Hammond, Louisiana area and fell in love with the positive and peaceful environment of The Waters at Hammond apartment complex. I am writing this review today because I would like to give a personal shoutout to Ms. Kamryn because she helped us choose The Waters as our new home.

Throughout our time researching the Waters, Ms. Kamryn has always made herself available for questions and concerns. She knew we were new to the apartment searching process and helped us feel more comfortable and at ease. Overall, Ms. Kamryn has done an amazing job helping us and I thank her for her excellent customer service.",2025,Treveon Williams,2025-08-13T12:26:44.203520

Beautiful property and great staff, from the office to the maintenance crew.  I do visit friends who live there and have enjoyed the pool and gym area many times last year.  The courtesy/police officer on site seems to be on top of her job (from what I have seen and heard).
About the courtesy/police officer (since I‚Äôve seen some bad reviews about her)‚Ä¶
I have witnessed her or her along with staff doing pool checks to make sure people are following the rules/policies of the property.  Two people per apartment seems to be a little strict but at the same time I understand there are over 300 apartments there.  It is good to know there are not a lot of outside people taking up all the space in the amenity areas (like some places may have).  I have spoken to her, and she seems to be as fair as a person can be.  Her motto: ‚ÄúRead your lease, follow the rules and respect your neighbors‚Äù.  What more could you ask for?  My friends say that she enforces the rules no matter what your race is and as fair as possible.  So, on the negative comments, I ask myself... Were they following the rules/policies?
About the negative comments, how many people read their lease COMPLETELY?  If they read what they were signing, then they would know the rules/policies of what they can and cannot do.",,Ray S,2025-08-13T12:26:44.901860

We made a simple mistake of misreading a sign and being in the pool 18 minutes after it closed and the ‚Äúcourtesy officer‚Äù barged in through the gate in a robe with no identification yelling at us demanding our unit number and personal information. After explaining it was a human mistake of misreading a sign from not using the pool often she continued yelling and demanding personal information and wasn‚Äôt providing any credentials and made us feel very unsafe. She is a very angry individual and regardless of us trying to repeatedly explain it being a human mistake and saying we were leaving immediately she kept yelling and said we ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know how to read‚Äù.  it made us feel very unsafe even walking back because we didn‚Äôt know if she was following.

Just to name a few safety issues, tons of the residents here speed through the parking lot going at least 25-30mph nearly causing accidents every day almost running into other cars and even people just walking around. You will be tailgated by other residents if you‚Äôre cruising around the parking lot too slowly. Tons of pet owners will not leash their dogs and will not pick up after them. Their pet waste can be found all over the grass for you or another resident/guest to step in.

The apartment units themselves may look nice on the inside but they seem to be built with cardboards purchased from Temu as there is barely any sound insulation. If you have a neighbor living above you, you will hear EVERYTHING. If someone is having a conversation outside your window, you will feel like you are a part of it and can hear every detail. At night, there is a quiet hours policy but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything. You can call the after hours number to complain but that will not do anything other than sending someone out to tell someone else that they‚Äôre noisy.

I moved into the Waters a few months ago as one of their first tenants and they have been nothing but hospitable and excellent the entire time. Regularly they will host small parties with excellent food and drink that offer great opportunities to meet new people and mingle with your neighbors.

The maintenance staff is very helpful and even helped me when I was in a jam moving furniture (Big shoutout to Ronald). The rest of the staff is awesome as well!

Ava helped me immensely in my leadup to moving in often answering questions over email in a few minutes and always happy to provide me with information at a moments notice, this was great for me as a first apartment experience.

Veronica has helped me several times with questions in regards to billing and even helped me get set up with my mobile device applications very quickly.

Tiffany is an excellent community manager. Her and the rest of her team exude hospitality and I have never felt like a nuisance with even the most trivial of questions. Tiffany even offered to help me resolve some issues with FPL on a moments notice.

The staff at Redstone is fantastic, always asking me how I am doing and being genuinely invested in their tenants. I would strongly recommend this apartment to anyone interested.

The amenities are also excellent with a fully stocked gym, pool, and self service Starbucks coffee machine. This place is very luxurious at  a very reasonable price.",,Kenneth Waters,2025-08-13T12:28:14.090370

I moved into a brand-new apartment that had never been occupied before. However, within just two months, the vinyl tile floors started coming up. At first, it wasn‚Äôt too serious, but by October, I submitted a maintenance request. The team attempted to fix the issue by gluing the floors down, but it only worsened, especially in my bedroom.
As the flooring continued to lift, creating a serious tripping hazard, I submitted another maintenance request and invited the leasing manager to see the problem in person. She declined my invitation, citing the need to sort Christmas decorations. This dismissal made me feel neglected and unimportant. Instead, she promised to come by the following Monday, which coincided with Thanksgiving week. I explained that I had family coming over and was concerned about the safety risk. When she finally arrived, she acknowledged the problem, saying it would only take a day to fix. She also asked if I wanted  to switch to a different unit. However, since it was during holiday season and my apartment was fully furnished and decorated, I preferred to stay, provided the floors could be repaired.
Despite explaining the urgency of the situation to her supervisor, I was left waiting for months with no resolution. What followed was a series of unprofessional delays, poor communication, and a complete lack of accountability. Though promises were made that the issue would be handled quickly, the floors weren‚Äôt repaired for over four months. Both the leasing manager and the property management team failed to follow up or provide any clarity when I repeatedly asked about the next steps as the floors were getting worse. I even inquired about moving to a different unit, specifically one facing the pond, but was told there were none available. They assured me that the repairs would be quick, but there was no clear plan in place.
In January 2025, I was finally informed that moisture tests would be conducted in my apartment on January 14th and that the replacement floors were on back order. After the tests were completed, they wanted to swiftly schedule the floor repairs, but once again, no concrete plan was provided when I asked how would the moving in and out  of my items would go and who would be financially responsible for packing materials. I was told that the property management team had never handled repairs in an occupied unit before and was unsure how to proceed. After months of living with hazardous floors, I sought legal help to address my concerns. By this point, I had developed an upper respiratory infection and had been to the ER, where I was diagnosed after weeks of persistent coughing and mucus.
Despite enduring months of living with unsafe floors, I was only offered partial rent credits for the time I couldn‚Äôt live comfortably in my apartment. I was also lied to about the moisture test, and the company ignored my lawyer‚Äôs requests for information. Once the floors were finally repaired, I asked for the underlying issues to be addressed to ensure my peace of mind, but my concerns were once again ignored.
What is most disappointing is how little the management team seemed to care about my actual living experience. They were more focused on hosting resident events and posting about them on social media than on maintaining a safe, comfortable, and respectful living environment. Though my floors were eventually repaired, the fundamental issues, as seen in the photos, were never properly tested or addressed, leaving me feeling unsafe in my own home.

**UPDATE**
SEE THIER YELP PAGE FOR MY COMPLETE REPONSE
The total disregard for my safety and the dismissal of my concerns after the tile was removed proves you could care less about a more positive living experience for my family and I. The new floors were swiftly put down without testing those spots for potential health hazards and that is extremely concerning.",2025,LaToya,2025-08-13T12:28:44.345245
