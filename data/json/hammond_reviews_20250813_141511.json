Rebecca Elliot was extremely kind and very knowledgeable when welcoming us in, presenting leasing options, and giving us a tour of the place. Very excited to be moving in here 2 months from now. Very clean, still has that brand new feel, and a very fresh and welcoming community space. This definitely will be the nicest rental property I’ve ever stayed at. Without a doubt the best apartment space to rent in Hammond, LA.",

We made a simple mistake of misreading a sign and being in the pool 18 minutes after it closed and the “courtesy officer” barged in through the gate in a robe with no identification yelling at us demanding our unit number and personal information. After explaining it was a human mistake of misreading a sign from not using the pool often she continued yelling and demanding personal information and wasn’t providing any credentials and made us feel very unsafe. She is a very angry individual and regardless of us trying to repeatedly explain it being a human mistake and saying we were leaving immediately she kept yelling and said we “didn’t know how to read”.  it made us feel very unsafe even walking back because we didn’t know if she was following.

They blew me away with how friendly the staff was and above all else their commitment to the assurance of safety and comfort that everyone wants in their home.\n\nAnytime I had a problem, a friendly voice was waiting on the other line to help. I almost wish I had more problems just so I can be blown away again by how quickly and efficiently my worries were dissolved.\n\nThe amenities are just the cherry on top as well when it comes to the experience at The Waters. The pool is always calling my name like a mermaid singing its song to attract wandering seamen. Unfortunately due to my fear of the ocean, I've never actually swam in the pool but have enjoyed numerous days poolside with friends and fellow neighbors.\n\nI would highly recommend giving this property a chance. Even if it's out of the way, it's worth making the trip. Even if you don't sign a lease, you'll still leave with a smile on your face. We need smiles more than ever in today's world.",

    "review_text": "VISITORS BEWARE!\n\nEarly on the morning of April 7th, I had arrived to the Waters to visit some friends after working all night. It was extremely busy in the parking lot with not many available parking spots. I cam up to an area that had a few and backed my truck into the spot. It was a covered section, but I did not think anything of it due to the fact that there were no signs out to inform guests where they can not park. Three hours later, I go to leave and notice my truck is no-where to be found and the office is closed. I had to track down who took my truck and try to understand why. My truck had been taken to Independence, LA. The tow-truck driver told me he has personally walked into the office and told them to put signs out warning people where they can and can not park. He is frequently called out to this complex because it is such a common occurrence. There was no indicator that someone specifically owned this spot.\n\nI called this morning to inquire about some of the rules and regulations of these spots and was informed by Taylor that whoever \"owns\" this spot can have anyone towed away without the office being involved. She also stated that she thinks they have some signs out but is not sure where they are located. When I spoke to Taylor this afternoon, she blandly stated three times that she understands my frustrations but there is nothing for them to do as if she really did not care.\n\nI have never been towed before because I always check to make sure I am in a safe parking spot where there are no signs warning me otherwise. But this place seems to think everyone is going to automatically know that some select spots are owned by other residents. They absolutely do not care about visitors, and while the property is lovely, I do not care to ever return nor recommend this place to anyone due to poor management.",

When I first moved in everyone was overly nice and attentive & communicative, but now since I’ve moved in, they are impossible to reach, never answer the phone, do not call you back, never respond to emails, which is all extremely unprofessional. People park in my designated spot which I have to pay for monthly, the gates are always broken and unauthorized people enter in which causes issues. Management procrastinates and you have to constantly call them for weeks to get a response. Now the valet trash is a huge issue, they outsource it & find the cheapest company who skip your unit never pick up your trash & the residents are STILL charged $50 fees even if it wasn’t your fault the people skipped your unit. Even though residents complain about this (and management even admitted they receive several complaints) nothing is done. Valet trash is not optional, you have to pay for it, even if they don't pick it up. This is a total waste of money. And, they don’t waive the $50 fee on your account regardless of how many times you call to get it resolved. They are completely unprofessional!  Do not move here, there are other places that are much more affordable & worth it. 2,000/month is not worth all of this.",

Raw sewage backed up into the apartment 4 times in 3 weeks.  Maintenance poured bleach on the feces in the tub.  Plumbers removed a blue cap that they stated was left during construction.  She asked for November rent to be waived and for them to replace her contaminated belongings . They told her they would give $500 off “in good faith”  and to use her renters insurance Bc  “that’s what it’s for”. They refuse to take responsibility, and the disregard for human life is 1000 times more disgusting than the feces that was piled in the tub!!!",

Very clean, still has that brand new feel, and a very fresh and welcoming community space. This definitely will be the nicest rental property I’ve ever stayed at. Without a doubt the best apartment space to rent in Hammond, LA.",

I had a wonderful experience on my tour and Ms. Kamryn was very helpful in answering all of my questions.\n\nMy friend and I were in the search of apartments in the Hammond, Louisiana area and fell in love with the positive and peaceful environment of The Waters at Hammond apartment complex. I am writing this review today because I would like to give a personal shoutout to Ms. Kamryn because she helped us choose The Waters as our new home.\n\nThroughout our time researching the Waters, Ms. Kamryn has always made herself available for questions and concerns. She knew we were new to the apartment searching process and helped us feel more comfortable and at ease. Overall, Ms. Kamryn has done an amazing job helping us and I thank her for her excellent customer service.",

I do visit friends who live there and have enjoyed the pool and gym area many times last year.  The courtesy/police officer on site seems to be on top of her job (from what I have seen and heard).\nAbout the courtesy/police officer (since I’ve seen some bad reviews about her)…\nI have witnessed her or her along with staff doing pool checks to make sure people are following the rules/policies of the property.  Two people per apartment seems to be a little strict but at the same time I understand there are over 300 apartments there.  It is good to know there are not a lot of outside people taking up all the space in the amenity areas (like some places may have).  I have spoken to her, and she seems to be as fair as a person can be.  Her motto: “Read your lease, follow the rules and respect your neighbors”.  What more could you ask for?  My friends say that she enforces the rules no matter what your race is and as fair as possible.  So, on the negative comments, I ask myself... Were they following the rules/policies?\nAbout the negative comments, how many people read their lease COMPLETELY?  If they read what they were signing, then they would know the rules/policies of what they can and cannot do.",

We made a simple mistake of misreading a sign and being in the pool 18 minutes after it closed and the “courtesy officer” barged in through the gate in a robe with no identification yelling at us demanding our unit number and personal information. After explaining it was a human mistake of misreading a sign from not using the pool often she continued yelling and demanding personal information and wasn’t providing any credentials and made us feel very unsafe. She is a very angry individual and regardless of us trying to repeatedly explain it being a human mistake and saying we were leaving immediately she kept yelling and said we “didn’t know how to read”.  it made us feel very unsafe even walking back because we didn’t know if she was following. Verbally insulting tenants for a 18 minute mistake and harassment isn’t necessary. Will not be using this amenity again.",

They blew me away with how friendly the staff was and above all else their commitment to the assurance of safety and comfort that everyone wants in their home.\n\nAnytime I had a problem, a friendly voice was waiting on the other line to help. I almost wish I had more problems just so I can be blown away again by how quickly and efficiently my worries were dissolved.\n\nThe amenities are just the cherry on top as well when it comes to the experience at The Waters. The pool is always calling my name like a mermaid singing its song to attract wandering seamen. Unfortunately due to my fear of the ocean, I've never actually swam in the pool but have enjoyed numerous days poolside with friends and fellow neighbors.\n\nI would highly recommend giving this property a chance. Even if it's out of the way, it's worth making the trip. Even if you don't sign a lease, you'll still leave with a smile on your face. We need smiles more than ever in today's world.",

    "review_text": "VISITORS BEWARE!\n\nEarly on the morning of April 7th, I had arrived to the Waters to visit some friends after working all night. It was extremely busy in the parking lot with not many available parking spots. I cam up to an area that had a few and backed my truck into the spot. It was a covered section, but I did not think anything of it due to the fact that there were no signs out to inform guests where they can not park. Three hours later, I go to leave and notice my truck is no-where to be found and the office is closed. I had to track down who took my truck and try to understand why. My truck had been taken to Independence, LA. The tow-truck driver told me he has personally walked into the office and told them to put signs out warning people where they can and can not park. He is frequently called out to this complex because it is such a common occurrence. There was no indicator that someone specifically owned this spot.\n\nI called this morning to inquire about some of the rules and regulations of these spots and was informed by Taylor that whoever \"owns\" this spot can have anyone towed away without the office being involved. She also stated that she thinks they have some signs out but is not sure where they are located. When I spoke to Taylor this afternoon, she blandly stated three times that she understands my frustrations but there is nothing for them to do as if she really did not care.\n\nI have never been towed before because I always check to make sure I am in a safe parking spot where there are no signs warning me otherwise. But this place seems to think everyone is going to automatically know that some select spots are owned by other residents. They absolutely do not care about visitors, and while the property is lovely, I do not care to ever return nor recommend this place to anyone due to poor management.",

People park in my designated spot which I have to pay for monthly, the gates are always broken and unauthorized people enter in which causes issues. Management procrastinates and you have to constantly call them for weeks to get a response. Now the valet trash is a huge issue, they outsource it & find the cheapest company who skip your unit never pick up your trash & the residents are STILL charged $50 fees even if it wasn’t your fault the people skipped your unit. Even though residents complain about this (and management even admitted they receive several complaints) nothing is done. Valet trash is not optional, you have to pay for it, even if they don't pick it up. This is a total waste of money. And, they don’t waive the $50 fee on your account regardless of how many times you call to get it resolved. They are completely unprofessional!

Raw sewage backed up into the apartment 4 times in 3 weeks.  Maintenance poured bleach on the feces in the tub.  Plumbers removed a blue cap that they stated was left during construction.  She asked for November rent to be waived and for them to replace her contaminated belongings . They told her they would give $500 off “in good faith”  and to use her renters insurance Bc  “that’s what it’s for”. They refuse to take responsibility, and the disregard for human life is 1000 times more disgusting than the feces that was piled in the tub!!!",

I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ENCOUNTERS IN WHICH SHE HAS VIDEO RECORDED MY UNIT AND ACCUSED ME OF HORRENDOUS ACTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN UNTRUE. SHE HAS TAKEN PICTURES OF MY GUEST AGAINST THEIR WILL ALONG WITH PICTURES OF THEIR VEHICLES. ALSO, SHE HAS BEEN CAUGHT TAKING PICTURES INSIDE OF MY GUEST’S VEHICLES.
