Rebecca Elliot was extremely kind and very knowledgeable when welcoming us in, presenting leasing options, and giving us a tour of the place. Very excited to be moving in here 2 months from now. Very clean, still has that brand new feel, and a very fresh and welcoming community space. This definitely will be the nicest rental property I’ve ever stayed at. Without a doubt the best apartment space to rent in Hammond, LA.",

I had a wonderful experience on my tour and Ms. Kamryn was very helpful in answering all of my questions.\n\nMy friend and I were in the search of apartments in the Hammond, Louisiana area and fell in love with the positive and peaceful environment of The Waters at Hammond apartment complex. I am writing this review today because I would like to give a personal shoutout to Ms. Kamryn because she helped us choose The Waters as our new home.\n\nThroughout our time researching the Waters, Ms. Kamryn has always made herself available for questions and concerns. She knew we were new to the apartment searching process and helped us feel more comfortable and at ease. Overall, Ms. Kamryn has done an amazing job helping us and I thank her for her excellent customer service.",

I hate pets inside my apartment but my kids love being on the patio or walking and see others walking their dogs. Chris, Erika, and Charlie feel like extended family.

I do visit friends who live there and have enjoyed the pool and gym area many times last year.  The courtesy/police officer on site seems to be on top of her job (from what I have seen and heard).\nAbout the courtesy/police officer (since I’ve seen some bad reviews about her)…\nI have witnessed her or her along with staff doing pool checks to make sure people are following the rules/policies of the property.  Two people per apartment seems to be a little strict but at the same time I understand there are over 300 apartments there.  It is good to know there are not a lot of outside people taking up all the space in the amenity areas (like some places may have).  I have spoken to her, and she seems to be as fair as a person can be.  Her motto: “Read your lease, follow the rules and respect your neighbors”.  What more could you ask for?  My friends say that she enforces the rules no matter what your race is and as fair as possible.  So, on the negative comments, I ask myself... Were they following the rules/policies?\nAbout the negative comments, how many people read their lease COMPLETELY?  If they read what they were signing, then they would know the rules/policies of what they can and cannot do.",

We made a simple mistake of misreading a sign and being in the pool 18 minutes after it closed and the “courtesy officer” barged in through the gate in a robe with no identification yelling at us demanding our unit number and personal information. After explaining it was a human mistake of misreading a sign from not using the pool often she continued yelling and demanding personal information and wasn’t providing any credentials and made us feel very unsafe. She is a very angry individual and regardless of us trying to repeatedly explain it being a human mistake and saying we were leaving immediately she kept yelling and said we “didn’t know how to read”.  it made us feel very unsafe even walking back because we didn’t know if she was following. Verbally insulting tenants for a 18 minute mistake and harassment isn’t necessary. Will not be using this amenity again.",

They blew me away with how friendly the staff was and above all else their commitment to the assurance of safety and comfort that everyone wants in their home.\n\nAnytime I had a problem, a friendly voice was waiting on the other line to help. I almost wish I had more problems just so I can be blown away again by how quickly and efficiently my worries were dissolved.\n\nThe amenities are just the cherry on top as well when it comes to the experience at The Waters. The pool is always calling my name like a mermaid singing its song to attract wandering seamen. Unfortunately due to my fear of the ocean, I've never actually swam in the pool but have enjoyed numerous days poolside with friends and fellow neighbors.\n\nI would highly recommend giving this property a chance. Even if it's out of the way, it's worth making the trip. Even if you don't sign a lease, you'll still leave with a smile on your face. We need smiles more than ever in today's world.",

    "Review_Text": "VISITORS BEWARE!\n\nEarly on the morning of April 7th, I had arrived to the Waters to visit some friends after working all night. It was extremely busy in the parking lot with not many available parking spots. I cam up to an area that had a few and backed my truck into the spot. It was a covered section, but I did not think anything of it due to the fact that there were no signs out to inform guests where they can not park. Three hours later, I go to leave and notice my truck is no-where to be found and the office is closed. I had to track down who took my truck and try to understand why. My truck had been taken to Independence, LA. The tow-truck driver told me he has personally walked into the office and told them to put signs out warning people where they can and can not park. He is frequently called out to this complex because it is such a common occurrence. There was no indicator that someone specifically owned this spot.\n\nI called this morning to inquire about some of the rules and regulations of these spots and was informed by Taylor that whoever \"owns\" this spot can have anyone towed away without the office being involved. She also stated that she thinks they have some signs out but is not sure where they are located. When I spoke to Taylor this afternoon, she blandly stated three times that she understands my frustrations but there is nothing for them to do as if she really did not care.\n\nI have never been towed before because I always check to make sure I am in a safe parking spot where there are no signs warning me otherwise. But this place seems to think everyone is going to automatically know that some select spots are owned by other residents. They absolutely do not care about visitors, and while the property is lovely, I do not care to ever return nor recommend this place to anyone due to poor management.",

When I first moved in everyone was overly nice and attentive & communicative, but now since I’ve moved in, they are impossible to reach, never answer the phone, do not call you back, never respond to emails, which is all extremely unprofessional. People park in my designated spot which I have to pay for monthly, the gates are always broken and unauthorized people enter in which causes issues. Management procrastinates and you have to constantly call them for weeks to get a response. Now the valet trash is a huge issue, they outsource it & find the cheapest company who skip your unit never pick up your trash & the residents are STILL charged $50 fees even if it wasn’t your fault the people skipped your unit. Even though residents complain about this (and management even admitted they receive several complaints) nothing is done. Valet trash is not optional, you have to pay for it, even if they don't pick it up. This is a total waste of money. And, they don’t waive the $50 fee on your account regardless of how many times you call to get it resolved. They are completely unprofessional!  Do not move here, there are other places that are much more affordable & worth it. 2,000/month is not worth all of this.",

Raw sewage backed up into the apartment 4 times in 3 weeks.  Maintenance poured bleach on the feces in the tub.  Plumbers removed a blue cap that they stated was left during construction.  She asked for November rent to be waived and for them to replace her contaminated belongings . They told her they would give $500 off “in good faith”  and to use her renters insurance Bc  “that’s what it’s for”. They refuse to take responsibility, and the disregard for human life is 1000 times more disgusting than the feces that was piled in the tub!!!",

I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ENCOUNTERS IN WHICH SHE HAS VIDEO RECORDED MY UNIT AND ACCUSED ME OF HORRENDOUS ACTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN UNTRUE. SHE HAS TAKEN PICTURES OF MY GUEST AGAINST THEIR WILL ALONG WITH PICTURES OF THEIR VEHICLES. ALSO, SHE HAS BEEN CAUGHT TAKING PICTURES INSIDE OF MY GUEST’S VEHICLES. THE APARTMENT COMPLEX’S MANAGER IS VERY RUDE. SHE REFERS TO PEOPLE WITH SUCH A DISGUSTING ATTITUDE AND NO REMORSE FOR HUMAN DECENCY AND RESPECT. 0/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",

If my leasing journey continues at The Flats at East Bay, I'm confident that Blane's excellent service will play a significant role in my decision-making process.\n\nThis was my second tour, and both times Blane made it not only enjoyable but also profoundly insightful, especially when touring a unit.\n\nTouring several apartments in the area, The Flats at East Bay has certainly made an impression and stood out. Blane’s dedication to providing exceptional service has truly set this community apart in the apartment search. Thanks again, Blane, for another meaningful and informative tour experience!",

They tried to reschedule my move-in time after I paid the movers to be here for a certain time, but we got over that.  A few months later this car came speeding through the parking lot and hit my car head on, and yet they put a sticker on my car in the parking lot in the spot that I pay for telling me that it will be towed because it doesn’t meet the physical requirements and the car was still driveable. A few months later, I was informed by the courtesy officer that they told him To put the ticket on my car because they rented out the spot that I currently pay for to a new resident without telling me, and without my permission and are still forcing me to move out of the spot for them when it was their mistake. I received no apology!",

    "Review_Text": "If you are considering moving here and want a safe, quiet, and friendly environment, look elsewhere. Just to name a few safety issues, tons of the residents here speed through the parking lot going at least 25-30mph nearly causing accidents every day almost running into other cars and even people just walking around. You will be tailgated by other residents if you’re cruising around the parking lot too slowly. Tons of pet owners will not leash their dogs and will not pick up after them. Their pet waste can be found all over the grass for you or another resident/guest to step in.\n\nThe apartment units themselves may look nice on the inside but they seem to be built with cardboards purchased from Temu as there is barely any sound insulation. If you have a neighbor living above you, you will hear EVERYTHING. If someone is having a conversation outside your window, you will feel like you are a part of it and can hear every detail. At night, there is a quiet hours policy but that doesn’t mean anything. You can call the after hours number to complain but that will not do anything other than sending someone out to tell someone else that they’re noisy.\n\nMy only positive about this place is that their maintenance team is to respond and fix things. Other than that, I would not live here again.",

As a potential tenant, it was a huge red flag because it makes no sense to move in, and a year from now, who knows what it will be.\nThey stated that the price was based on the market but what market Im unusre. We looked at 4 other apartments on the street and none of them went up.\nWhen I asked the lady she stated that their prices go up every Monday!!! You can definitely tell they are not locally owned.\nI saw tons of great 5 star reviews , which made me look but with it being new everyone is nice when you sign up its the after effect that I look at.\nIm so glad I caught the price increase on the paperwork she gave me and asked.\nAGAIN, staff was nice but whoever owns this place.

A one bed room at minimum if you’re going to make it pricey should be at least 1,000-1,100. Also, the carports being $60 dollars a month is DIABOLICALLY RIDICULOUS😭😂 on top of your rent?! C’mon now. I want to also point out, be on top of your P&Q’s if you’re going to let 3rd party companies work on the complex/ community. Also, no refunds is nasty work(especially if you guys mess up on your end.. unintentionally though) I understand things do happen. Also, the stair cases stained with dog piss and the community filled with dog doodoo is baffling💀. Please have somebody pressure wash the place or something. You guys preach how you want the community to look clean, but yet it’s not… at all. Plus the whole smart lock thing, why charge more on people’s rent for that? We already paying thousands dollars a year. That should be free lmao. Like what? I’m just trying to give tips that’s all. Other than that, I love the fact that there are community events!!!! Veronica is the the most sweetest person I know!!! That’s my little bestie 😂🫶🏾  I also would recommend a basketball court! That would be so TUFF!!!!! The pool great addition bc it’s hot. People here are friendly & I love the maintenance team.",

Regularly they will host small parties with excellent food and drink that offer great opportunities to meet new people and mingle with your neighbors.\n\nThe maintenance staff is very helpful and even helped me when I was in a jam moving furniture (Big shoutout to Ronald). The rest of the staff is awesome as well!\n\nAva helped me immensely in my leadup to moving in often answering questions over email in a few minutes and always happy to provide me with information at a moments notice, this was great for me as a first apartment experience.\n\nVeronica has helped me several times with questions in regards to billing and even helped me get set up with my mobile device applications very quickly.\n\nTiffany is an excellent community manager. Her and the rest of her team exude hospitality and I have never felt like a nuisance with even the most trivial of questions. Tiffany even offered to help me resolve some issues with FPL on a moments notice.\n\nThe staff at Redstone is fantastic, always asking me how I am doing and being genuinely invested in their tenants. I would strongly recommend this apartment to anyone interested.\n\nThe amenities are also excellent with a fully stocked gym, pool, and self service Starbucks coffee machine. This place is very luxurious at  a very reasonable price.",

It's all up-to-date, modern design and right next to grocery stores and many other stores. The price is about what you'd expect for an apartment in Lafayette, especially in a nice area. Management is very helpful to us, which you won't find at many apartment complexes, I hope it stays this way. There is the issue of residents leaving trash outside of the compactor which is rude, especially considering these are brand new. I have yet to live in an apartment as great as this one is.",

With the recent transfer of The Waters from being managed by Stoa Group to now Greystar, I am highly concerned the quality is going to go down. Right now, I do not think I will renew my lease because of all the management changes and not to mention how many times their fire alarm company needs to be on property. They needed to do work all day on June 9th and now they need to do more work on July 10th? It's the biggest hassle to be disturbed when you are paying a premium price (1500+) for an apartment. I guess we will see how this goes, but I don't think the quality is going to get any better. If anything, worse. It's like any apartment management company really, they just care about your money.",

    "Review_Text": "My experience at The Waters at West Village began on a positive note, but it quickly turned into a nightmare. I moved into a brand-new apartment that had never been occupied before. However, within just two months, the vinyl tile floors started coming up. At first, it wasn’t too serious, but by October, I submitted a maintenance request. The team attempted to fix the issue by gluing the floors down, but it only worsened, especially in my bedroom.\nAs the flooring continued to lift, creating a serious tripping hazard, I submitted another maintenance request and invited the leasing manager to see the problem in person. She declined my invitation, citing the need to sort Christmas decorations. This dismissal made me feel neglected and unimportant. Instead, she promised to come by the following Monday, which coincided with Thanksgiving week. I explained that I had family coming over and was concerned about the safety risk. When she finally arrived, she acknowledged the problem, saying it would only take a day to fix. She also asked if I wanted  to switch to a different unit. However, since it was during holiday season and my apartment was fully furnished and decorated, I preferred to stay, provided the floors could be repaired.\nDespite explaining the urgency of the situation to her supervisor, I was left waiting for months with no resolution. What followed was a series of unprofessional delays, poor communication, and a complete lack of accountability. Though promises were made that the issue would be handled quickly, the floors weren’t repaired for over four months. Both the leasing manager and the property management team failed to follow up or provide any clarity when I repeatedly asked about the next steps as the floors were getting worse. I even inquired about moving to a different unit, specifically one facing the pond, but was told there were none available. They assured me that the repairs would be quick, but there was no clear plan in place.\nIn January 2025, I was finally informed that moisture tests would be conducted in my apartment on January 14th and that the replacement floors were on back order. After the tests were completed, they wanted to swiftly schedule the floor repairs, but once again, no concrete plan was provided when I asked how would the moving in and out  of my items would go and who would be financially responsible for packing materials. I was told that the property management team had never handled repairs in an occupied unit before and was unsure how to proceed. After months of living with hazardous floors, I sought legal help to address my concerns. By this point, I had developed an upper respiratory infection and had been to the ER, where I was diagnosed after weeks of persistent coughing and mucus.\nDespite enduring months of living with unsafe floors, I was only offered partial rent credits for the time I couldn’t live comfortably in my apartment. I was also lied to about the moisture test, and the company ignored my lawyer’s requests for information. Once the floors were finally repaired, I asked for the underlying issues to be addressed to ensure my peace of mind, but my concerns were once again ignored.\nWhat is most disappointing is how little the management team seemed to care about my actual living experience. They were more focused on hosting resident events and posting about them on social media than on maintaining a safe, comfortable, and respectful living environment. Though my floors were eventually repaired, the fundamental issues, as seen in the photos, were never properly tested or addressed, leaving me feeling unsafe in my own home.\n\n**UPDATE**\nSEE THIER YELP PAGE FOR MY COMPLETE REPONSE\nThe total disregard for my safety and the dismissal of my concerns after the tile was removed proves you could care less about a more positive living experience for my family and I. The new floors were swiftly put down without testing those spots for potential health hazards and that is extremely concerning.",
