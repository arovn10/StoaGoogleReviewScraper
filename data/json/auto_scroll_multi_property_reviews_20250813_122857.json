Rebecca Elliot was extremely kind and very knowledgeable when welcoming us in, presenting leasing options, and giving us a tour of the place. Very excited to be moving in here 2 months from now. Very clean, still has that brand new feel, and a very fresh and welcoming community space. This definitely will be the nicest rental property I’ve ever stayed at. Without a doubt the best apartment space to rent in Hammond, LA.",

I had a wonderful experience on my tour and Ms. Kamryn was very helpful in answering all of my questions.\n\nMy friend and I were in the search of apartments in the Hammond, Louisiana area and fell in love with the positive and peaceful environment of The Waters at Hammond apartment complex. I am writing this review today because I would like to give a personal shoutout to Ms. Kamryn because she helped us choose The Waters as our new home.\n\nThroughout our time researching the Waters, Ms. Kamryn has always made herself available for questions and concerns. She knew we were new to the apartment searching process and helped us feel more comfortable and at ease. Overall, Ms. Kamryn has done an amazing job helping us and I thank her for her excellent customer service.",

I hate pets inside my apartment but my kids love being on the patio or walking and see others walking their dogs. Chris, Erika, and Charlie feel like extended family.

I do visit friends who live there and have enjoyed the pool and gym area many times last year.  The courtesy/police officer on site seems to be on top of her job (from what I have seen and heard).\nAbout the courtesy/police officer (since I’ve seen some bad reviews about her)…\nI have witnessed her or her along with staff doing pool checks to make sure people are following the rules/policies of the property.  Two people per apartment seems to be a little strict but at the same time I understand there are over 300 apartments there.  It is good to know there are not a lot of outside people taking up all the space in the amenity areas (like some places may have).  I have spoken to her, and she seems to be as fair as a person can be.  Her motto: “Read your lease, follow the rules and respect your neighbors”.  What more could you ask for?  My friends say that she enforces the rules no matter what your race is and as fair as possible.  So, on the negative comments, I ask myself... Were they following the rules/policies?\nAbout the negative comments, how many people read their lease COMPLETELY?  If they read what they were signing, then they would know the rules/policies of what they can and cannot do.",

We made a simple mistake of misreading a sign and being in the pool 18 minutes after it closed and the “courtesy officer” barged in through the gate in a robe with no identification yelling at us demanding our unit number and personal information. After explaining it was a human mistake of misreading a sign from not using the pool often she continued yelling and demanding personal information and wasn’t providing any credentials and made us feel very unsafe. She is a very angry individual and regardless of us trying to repeatedly explain it being a human mistake and saying we were leaving immediately she kept yelling and said we “didn’t know how to read”.  it made us feel very unsafe even walking back because we didn’t know if she was following. Verbally insulting tenants for a 18 minute mistake and harassment isn’t necessary. Will not be using this amenity again.",

They tried to reschedule my move-in time after I paid the movers to be here for a certain time, but we got over that.  A few months later this car came speeding through the parking lot and hit my car head on, and yet they put a sticker on my car in the parking lot in the spot that I pay for telling me that it will be towed because it doesn’t meet the physical requirements and the car was still driveable. A few months later, I was informed by the courtesy officer that they told him To put the ticket on my car because they rented out the spot that I currently pay for to a new resident without telling me, and without my permission and are still forcing me to move out of the spot for them when it was their mistake.

    "Review_Text": "If you are considering moving here and want a safe, quiet, and friendly environment, look elsewhere. Just to name a few safety issues, tons of the residents here speed through the parking lot going at least 25-30mph nearly causing accidents every day almost running into other cars and even people just walking around. You will be tailgated by other residents if you’re cruising around the parking lot too slowly. Tons of pet owners will not leash their dogs and will not pick up after them. Their pet waste can be found all over the grass for you or another resident/guest to step in.\n\nThe apartment units themselves may look nice on the inside but they seem to be built with cardboards purchased from Temu as there is barely any sound insulation. If you have a neighbor living above you, you will hear EVERYTHING. If someone is having a conversation outside your window, you will feel like you are a part of it and can hear every detail. At night, there is a quiet hours policy but that doesn’t mean anything. You can call the after hours number to complain but that will not do anything other than sending someone out to tell someone else that they’re noisy.\n\nMy only positive about this place is that their maintenance team is to respond and fix things. Other than that, I would not live here again.",

A one bed room at minimum if you’re going to make it pricey should be at least 1,000-1,100. Also, the carports being $60 dollars a month is DIABOLICALLY RIDICULOUS😭😂 on top of your rent?! C’mon now. I want to also point out, be on top of your P&Q’s if you’re going to let 3rd party companies work on the complex/ community. Also, no refunds is nasty work(especially if you guys mess up on your end.. unintentionally though) I understand things do happen. Also, the stair cases stained with dog piss and the community filled with dog doodoo is baffling💀. Please have somebody pressure wash the place or something. You guys preach how you want the community to look clean, but yet it’s not… at all. Plus the whole smart lock thing, why charge more on people’s rent for that? We already paying thousands dollars a year. That should be free lmao. Like what? I’m just trying to give tips that’s all. Other than that, I love the fact that there are community events!!!! Veronica is the the most sweetest person I know!!! That’s my little bestie 😂🫶🏾  I also would recommend a basketball court! That would be so TUFF!!!!! The pool great addition bc it’s hot. People here are friendly & I love the maintenance team.",

Her and the rest of her team exude hospitality and I have never felt like a nuisance with even the most trivial of questions. Tiffany even offered to help me resolve some issues with FPL on a moments notice.\n\nThe staff at Redstone is fantastic, always asking me how I am doing and being genuinely invested in their tenants. I would strongly recommend this apartment to anyone interested.\n\nThe amenities are also excellent with a fully stocked gym, pool, and self service Starbucks coffee machine.

It's all up-to-date, modern design and right next to grocery stores and many other stores. The price is about what you'd expect for an apartment in Lafayette, especially in a nice area. Management is very helpful to us, which you won't find at many apartment complexes, I hope it stays this way. There is the issue of residents leaving trash outside of the compactor which is rude, especially considering these are brand new. I have yet to live in an apartment as great as this one is.",

With the recent transfer of The Waters from being managed by Stoa Group to now Greystar, I am highly concerned the quality is going to go down. Right now, I do not think I will renew my lease because of all the management changes and not to mention how many times their fire alarm company needs to be on property. They needed to do work all day on June 9th and now they need to do more work on July 10th? It's the biggest hassle to be disturbed when you are paying a premium price (1500+) for an apartment. I guess we will see how this goes, but I don't think the quality is going to get any better. If anything, worse. It's like any apartment management company really, they just care about your money.",

The neighborhood feels safe, clean, and welcoming, with friendly neighbors and plenty of green spaces to enjoy.\n\nI highly recommend the Waters at Settlers Trace to anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish, and hassle-free place to live! It truly feels like a home of your own.",

I’ve reported it, but they said there’s nothing they can do. My baby and I get woken up every single night because of it. Other than that, I really love my apartment it’s just the nightly noise:(",

At the end of the tour Grant gave us all the information we needed to move forward and even told us where to set up electricity and cable which was super helpful coming from out of state.  So far we have settled in nicely and cant wait to go to community events in the future! 10/10!",

    "Review_Text": "My experience at The Waters at West Village began on a positive note, but it quickly turned into a nightmare. I moved into a brand-new apartment that had never been occupied before. However, within just two months, the vinyl tile floors started coming up. At first, it wasn’t too serious, but by October, I submitted a maintenance request. The team attempted to fix the issue by gluing the floors down, but it only worsened, especially in my bedroom.\nAs the flooring continued to lift, creating a serious tripping hazard, I submitted another maintenance request and invited the leasing manager to see the problem in person. She declined my invitation, citing the need to sort Christmas decorations. This dismissal made me feel neglected and unimportant. Instead, she promised to come by the following Monday, which coincided with Thanksgiving week. I explained that I had family coming over and was concerned about the safety risk. When she finally arrived, she acknowledged the problem, saying it would only take a day to fix. She also asked if I wanted  to switch to a different unit. However, since it was during holiday season and my apartment was fully furnished and decorated, I preferred to stay, provided the floors could be repaired.\nDespite explaining the urgency of the situation to her supervisor, I was left waiting for months with no resolution. What followed was a series of unprofessional delays, poor communication, and a complete lack of accountability. Though promises were made that the issue would be handled quickly, the floors weren’t repaired for over four months. Both the leasing manager and the property management team failed to follow up or provide any clarity when I repeatedly asked about the next steps as the floors were getting worse. I even inquired about moving to a different unit, specifically one facing the pond, but was told there were none available. They assured me that the repairs would be quick, but there was no clear plan in place.\nIn January 2025, I was finally informed that moisture tests would be conducted in my apartment on January 14th and that the replacement floors were on back order. After the tests were completed, they wanted to swiftly schedule the floor repairs, but once again, no concrete plan was provided when I asked how would the moving in and out  of my items would go and who would be financially responsible for packing materials. I was told that the property management team had never handled repairs in an occupied unit before and was unsure how to proceed. After months of living with hazardous floors, I sought legal help to address my concerns. By this point, I had developed an upper respiratory infection and had been to the ER, where I was diagnosed after weeks of persistent coughing and mucus.\nDespite enduring months of living with unsafe floors, I was only offered partial rent credits for the time I couldn’t live comfortably in my apartment. I was also lied to about the moisture test, and the company ignored my lawyer’s requests for information. Once the floors were finally repaired, I asked for the underlying issues to be addressed to ensure my peace of mind, but my concerns were once again ignored.\nWhat is most disappointing is how little the management team seemed to care about my actual living experience. They were more focused on hosting resident events and posting about them on social media than on maintaining a safe, comfortable, and respectful living environment. Though my floors were eventually repaired, the fundamental issues, as seen in the photos, were never properly tested or addressed, leaving me feeling unsafe in my own home.\n\n**UPDATE**\nSEE THIER YELP PAGE FOR MY COMPLETE REPONSE\nThe total disregard for my safety and the dismissal of my concerns after the tile was removed proves you could care less about a more positive living experience for my family and I. The new floors were swiftly put down without testing those spots for potential health hazards and that is extremely concerning.",
